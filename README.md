# Data Analysis Project -- ML-Regression-Project-Sales-Prediction

An Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, Corporation Favorita, needs a model that accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at their different stores.


In this project, we will use regression, a specific type of supervised machine learning that focuses on predicting continuous numerical values, to predict grocery store sales for the thousands of product families sold at Favorita stores located in Ecuador. The training data includes dates, store and product information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the sales numbers.

## Project Description
This Project is a data science and machine learning initiative focused on predicting store sales trends, enabling retailers to:

### . Anticipate and plan for future sales across multiple stores.
### . Allocate resources efficiently.
### .Optimize inventory management.
### .Enhance overall profitability.

## **Column names and description in Final Data:**

-   **oil.csv**:  Historical data on oil prices

-   **stores**:  Information about store details.

-   **holidays_events.csv**: Dataset containing information about holidays and events.
-    **test.csv**: Test dataset for model evaluation.
-    **transactions.csv**: Transaction history data.

-  **train.csv**: Training dataset for model development.

## Process

-   Pull data from remote database with pyodbc; save as csv files

-   Develop questions and a hypothesis to base analysis of the project on

-   Understand the data and make decisions on how to process the data

-   Data preprocessing, cleaning and merging- The data was very messy and 90% of the project involved cleaning and making the data ready for analysis and visualizations

-   Visualise the data with seaborn and pyplot

-   Created a PowerBI dashboard with the visualizations

-   Wrote a medium article and briefly described the process, findings and recommendations
